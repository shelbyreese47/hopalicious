## User Stories

### MVP Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to see a random beer recipe if I don't know what I want to search for
- As a user, I want to be able to search for the different components of the beer I would like to brew so I can brew according to what I have on hand/what I'm going for (type of yeast, hops, IBUs etc)
- As a user, I want to easily navigate through the website so that I don't get confused about where to go

### Stretch Goals

- As a user, I would like to shuffle through random recipes so I can get inspiration for what to brew
- As a user, I would like to see animations when a button or recipe is clicked on so I know it's accepting my input
- As a user, I would like drop down menus for the search items so I know what options I have
- As a user, I would like to be able to open the recipe on my phone (and have it look great) so I can more easily access it while I shop/brew
- As a user, I want to have a shopping list that can add ingredients I do not have from the recipes to it so I don't forget anything at the store
- As a user, I would like to 'favorite' a recipe and have a favorites tab so I can come back to which beers I want to brew
